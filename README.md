# Image Segmentation Using k-means Clustering
This application carries out image segmentation using the k-means clustering algorithm. It uses a GUI to allow the user to select images, 
enter parameters for the k-means clustering algorithm and then save the resulting image. 

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) must be installed on your computer to open and run this application.

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. In MATLAB, navigate to the directory in which the repository was downloaded/installed
3. Use the Run button to start the GUI script

### Usage
Using the application's GUI you can select the image you wish to process, enter how many colours you would like the output image to
contain and set the maximum number of times the k-means clustering algorithm can iterate. Once processed, the image can then be
saved.
