# Image Segmentation Using k-means Clustering
This application carries out image segmentation using the k-means clustering algorithm. It uses a GUI to allow the user to select images, 
enter parameters for the k-means clustering algorithm and then save the resulting image. 

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) must be installed on your computer to open and run this application.

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the directory in which the repository was downloaded/installed in MATLAB
3. Run the GUI script in MATLAB

### Usage
Using the application's GUI you can select the image you wish to process, enter how many colours you would like the output image to
contain as well as the maximum number of time the k-means clustering algorithm can iterate. Once processed, the image can then be
saved.
